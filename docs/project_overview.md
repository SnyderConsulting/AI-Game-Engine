# Project Overview

AI-Game-Engine is a sandbox for prototyping browser-based 2D games. The repository provides skeleton code and guidelines so contributors can quickly iterate on gameplay features.

Key goals:

- Maintain lightweight, modular code.
- Keep documentation up to date with code changes.
- Provide clear separation between frontend and backend components.
- Includes a sample Tic Tac Toe game demonstrating basic client/server
  interaction.
