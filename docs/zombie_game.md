# Zombie Survival Example

This repository includes a minimal zombie survival demo to showcase basic canvas-based gameplay.

## Running the Example

### Frontend
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

The game runs entirely in the browser. Open `http://localhost:3000` to play. Use the arrow keys or WASD to move the green player blob. Red zombies spawn randomly and slowly move toward you. If a zombie touches you, the game ends.
