# Zombie Survival Example

This repository includes a minimal zombie survival demo to showcase basic canvas-based gameplay.

## Running the Example

### Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

The game runs entirely in the browser. Open `http://localhost:3000` and you will be greeted with a simple main menu. Click **Start Game** to jump into the action. Use the arrow keys or WASD to move the green player blob. The player still spawns randomly, but zombies now emerge from a single door placed along the outer edge of the arena. A new zombie steps through this door every 3â€“5 seconds. They roam toward random destinations so they naturally spread out but will pursue the player once spotted. Grey wall segments are scattered around the level and block both you and the zombies. The fullscreen layout now uses about twenty segments instead of just four. If a zombie touches you, the game ends and a **New Game** button appears so you can immediately play again.

The canvas now automatically resizes to fill the entire browser window so the action takes up all available space.

Players now have a small health pool instead of dying instantly. A "Health" display shows the remaining points. Each zombie also has a simple green bar above its head to indicate remaining health.
The on-screen control instructions are fixed to the bottom-left corner so they never cover the health readout.

The arena contains a single melee weapon that can be picked up. Press the spacebar to swing the weapon. The swing now follows the last direction you moved, creating a short arc in front of the player. Zombies hit by the swing take damage, are pushed back slightly, and can be struck from a small distance away. Turrets no longer spawn automatically; future updates will let players place them manually.

## Inventory System

Press **I** to open the 5x5 inventory grid. Items stack up to 10 per slot. A five slot hotbar sits at the bottom of the screen for quick use. Drag to rearrange items or right click to move them to the hotbar. Use the number keys **1-5** to use hotbar items.

## Zombie Drops

Zombies may drop **core**, **flesh**, or **teeth** when killed. Walk over a dropped icon to collect it if you have space. Items remain on the ground when the inventory is full and a brief pickup message appears when collecting or using items.
